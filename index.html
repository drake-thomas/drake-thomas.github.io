		This website is a place to put content I think might appeal to an audience larger than one.
		Expect assorted writeups, lists of otherwise not-well-curated items, and things I've made for lack of anyone else creating them.
	</p>

	<p>
		Broad areas of interest of mine include: math puzzles, non-math puzzles, ways of improving individual or community epistemics, fermi estimation and ways to train and improve at it, spaced repetition, long hikes to strange places, AI alignment, incentive design, novel social technologies, interesting features of the natural world (read: geography trivia), and baking.

		If you’re on the fence, err on the side of saying hi! I am happy every time I get contacted by cool people on the internet.

		As of this writing, this website remains a disaster in progress and should not be assumed to contain all content it asserts it contains.

	<p>The code for this website is based off of <a href ="https://elityre.com/">Eli Tyre's</a>, and many of the edits thereafter are thanks to advice from various LLMs.</p>
