	<h2>Things to Buy</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you bake at home, get some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disposable-Thicker-Plastic-Elastic-Portable/dp/B07VXPM8RJ">disposable shower caps</a>: they're an extremely cheap reusable way to cover many sizes of bowl and see how the dough's doing inside. I also like covering sheet pans with <a href="amazon.com/dp/B089QBN7YH">these bags</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			A high-quality cordless vacuum becomes convenient enough to use that you start actually using it even when guests aren't coming over - it's one of the household items I'm most happy to have shelled out extra money for. (We have a <a href="https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/cordless/v10/absolute-nickel-copper">Dyson V10 Cyclone Absolute</a>.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Extremely comfortable furniture, like the maximally-soft-and-cozy <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Ethereal-Shag-Grey-7-ft-x-10-ft-Indoor-Area-Rug-447120/205684834">Home Depot Ethereal Shag Rug</a> (eternal glory to Duncan Sabien for discovering this one) or <a href="https://www.target.com/p/king-microplush-bed-blanket-black-threshold-8482/-/A-78421260">very soft blankets</a> (not making claims to optimality for this one, it's just pretty cheap and good).
			</br></br>
			I also love <a href="https://www.worldmarket.com/product/rattan+double+papasan+chair+frame.do">this chair frame</a> from World Market combined with <a href="https://www.worldmarket.com/product/elora-speckled-oatmeal-double-papasan-chair-cushion.do">this cushion</a> (it just wraps you up like a burrito), but it takes up a lot of floorspace and is extremely inconvenient to order because availability is spotty and they refuse to deliver.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://store.dandelionchocolate.com/#Chocolate-Bars">Dandelion Chocolate</a> makes interesting and reliably tasty high-quality chocolate bars that taste shockingly different from ordinary chocolate or each other. Makes a good gift choice, too.
		</li>
		<li>
			A small bottle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonna-Pias-Classic-Balsamic-Glaze/dp/B06X9V7YWF/">balsamic glaze</a> lasts forever and is a great way to brighten up foods for which a little extra acidity and sweetness would help. I drizzle it over ice cream, add as a garnish on pasta dishes, and apply to pizzas that don't have enough tomato sauce to bring the necessary sweetness + acidity.
		</li>
		<li>
			I'm not usually one for cute bodycare products, but shampoo bars last a shockingly long time, smell nice, and don't require me to fumble with the plastic top of a precarious bottle. (They lather way more than you'd naively expect.) I like <a href="https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/jumping-juniper/9999905126.html">these</a> <a href="https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/montalbano/9999905127.html">two</a> from Lush but I haven't sampled very many.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Things to Do</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Download <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">an adblocker</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you don't like it when apps coerce your perfectly good ASCII emoticons into distorted cartoon faces, you can set up text replacements to convert [colon, end parenthesis] to [colon, unicode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space">zero-width space</a>, end parenthesis].
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Cooking/baking</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Lots of recipes call for an egg wash that uses an egg and a bit of water or milk, but only require 20% of the resulting mix. You can recycle this into a mini omelette or something if you like, but an alternative is to separate out the white into a separate container, and only use the yolk. (You can add whites separated in this way to a container in the freezer, and use them when you need a bunch for meringue or something.</li>
